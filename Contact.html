                    <p>David Lynch: There was a time when I had silver visions. They were large and small. The small
                        visions twinkled and sparkled liked jewels. I wanted to epoxy them to my nose so I could see
                        them 60 times a minute. The large visions would come up into my esophagus, and I would think
                        about all the animals I had known and the panoramas, which at that time weren’t apparent,
                        weren’t even married, as they were 9 at the time. It was sweet, the way they crawled on the
                        wall. I never put it together until later that this was on a Friday, like today.

                    <br>
                    <p>Deep Throat: Why are those like yourself who believe in the existence of extra-terrestrial life
                        on this Earth not dissuaded by all the evidence to the contrary?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Mulder: Because, all the evidence to the contrary is not entirely dissuasive.</p>

                    <p>Roy: I know this sounds crazy, but ever since yesterday on the road, I've been seeing this shape.
                        Shaving cream, pillows... Dammit! I know this. I know what this is! This means something. This
                        is important.
